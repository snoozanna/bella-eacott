          Massages will always be tailored to you and what you need, and every
          appointment starts with a conversation to find out about your needs,
          preferences, symptoms and medical history.
        </p>

        <ul>
          The kinds of treatment I offer include:
          <li>
            Relaxing and holistic massage, which uses lighter strokes,
            aromatherapy essential oils and tends to be a full body massage
          </li>
          <li>
            Deep tissue massage, which tends to also be full body but using
            slightly stronger pressure
          </li>
          <li>
            Pregnancy and post natal massage, tailored towards the needs of
            pregnant people and new parents{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            Sports and remedial massage which focuses on particular areas of
            concern / injuries and often uses more active approaches, longer
            consultation at the start and time for rehabilitation advice and
            exercises at the end.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          During treatments I draw on a range of techniques and approaches which
          may include combining relaxing and holistic massage strokes, deeper
          tissue techniques, mobilisation, myofascial release, stretching and
          take-home or exercise advice as needed; the pressure I use will be
          guided by dialogue between us. My approach draws on the understanding
          of anatomy and physiology, pathology, biomechanics and rehabilitation
          that underpin my training in osteopathy.
        </p>

        <p>
          My practice aims to be actively consent led, body neutral / positive,
          gender and sexuality affirmative and anti-racist; I try to be aware of
          the influence of my own embodied experiences - as a middle-class,
          queer, white woman - on my professional and personal interactions. In
          practice this means I communicate what to expect, ask questions where
          appropriate so that I donâ€™t make assumptions. If I think you may
          benefit from treatment from someone else (another kind of
          practitioner, such as an acupuncturist, for instance) I will always
          recommend them to you too.
